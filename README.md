# MALDI-Calculation

MALDI Calculation is a program to calculate possible polymer structures with a combination of known/predicted monomer structures. The user needs to provide molecular weights (MWs) of monomer structures – “monomer_weight”, found polymer MWs by MALDI or any MassSpec tools – “polymer_weight”, possible numbers of monomer units – “range_bottom” (minimum) and “range_top” (maximum), and error range – “error_number”.
